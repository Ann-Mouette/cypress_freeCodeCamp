# Cypress Testing Project

This repository contains a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project that has been enhanced with automated tests written using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). It demonstrates both web development skills and the ability to write end-to-end (E2E) tests for a modern web application.

## Project Overview

This project was built with `create-next-app` and includes the following:

- A functional Next.js application.
- Automated tests written using Cypress for validating the application's behavior.

The repository is designed to showcase proficiency in:

- Writing clean and maintainable code.
- Setting up and executing end-to-end tests with Cypress.
- Debugging and verifying application behavior through testing.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

## Running Cypress Tests

This project includes Cypress tests for end-to-end testing. To run the tests:

1. Open the Cypress Test Runner:
   ```bash
   npx cypress open
   ```

2. Select the desired test suite or file from the Cypress interface.

3. Alternatively, run all tests in headless mode:
   ```bash
   npx cypress run
   ```
